Importing data for activity
```{r}
# Importing R object
michiganFlights <- read_rds("fullMiFlights2021.rds")
```

Extracting data sets from list object
```{r}
list2env(michiganFlights, envir = .GlobalEnv)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
# Running glimpse function on each element of list using map() function from purrr package
purrr::map(.x = michiganFlights, .f = glimpse)
```

```{r}
skim(airlines)
skim(airports)
skim(flights)
skim(planes)
skim(weather)
```


**The `flights` and `planes` data set connect through which variable(s)?**

The `tailnum` variable connects the 2 tables


**The `flights` and `airports` data set connect through which variable(s)?**

The `faa`, `origin`, and `dest` variables connect the 2 tables


**The `flights` and `weather` data set connect through which variable(s)?**

All of the common time variables (`year`, `month`, `day`, and `hour`), and the location (`origin`).


**Suppose we wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from its origin to its destination. Which variables would we need? Which tables would we need to combine?**

**Table(s)**:
`flights` and `airports`


**Variable(s)**:
From `flights`, we would need `origin` and `dest`.
From `airports`, we would need `lat` and `lon`.


*Now suppose we wanted to explore typical weather patterns for departing flights at different airports and explore the weatherâ€™s relationship with departure delays. Considering the wind speeds and amount of precipitation, which variables would we need for this? Which tables would we need to combine?*

**Table(s)**:
`flights` and `weather`

**Variable(s)**:
From `flights` we would need dep_delay`.
From `weather` we would need `wind_dir`, `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, and `precip`.

## Joins

*Combine the airlines and flights data frames with left_join() to create a new data set called flightsCarriers.*
```{r}
# Combining airlines and flights data frames with left_join()
flightsCarriers <- flights %>% left_join(airlines, by = c("carrier" = "carrier"))

# Calculate the average flight distance for each carrier using the full name of the carriers. 
flightsCarriers %>% group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(AvgDistance = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(AvgDistance)
```

*Combine the weather and flights data frames with left_join() to create a new data set called weatherFlights.*
```{r}
# Combining the weather and flights data frames with left_join()
weatherFlights <- weather %>% left_join(flights)

# Displays the number of rows weatherFlights has
nrow(weatherFlights)
```

*Combine the flights and weather data frames with left_join() to create new data set called flightsWeather*
```{r}
flightsWeather <- flights %>% left_join(weather,
                                        by = c("year", "month", "day", "origin", "hour"))

# Displaying number of rows in data set
nrow(flightsWeather)
```

*Combine the weather and flights data frames with full_join() to create a new data set called weatherFlightsFull.*
```{r}
weatherFlightsFull <- flights %>% full_join(weather)

# Displaying number of rows in data set
nrow(weatherFlightsFull)
```

*Considering all of the data we have available, how many flights have missing wind speeds?*
```{r}
flightsWeather %>% pull(wind_speed) %>% is.na() %>% sum()
```
